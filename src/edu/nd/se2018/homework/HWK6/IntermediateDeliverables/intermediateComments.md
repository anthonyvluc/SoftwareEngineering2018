Here, I setup my initial program setup. I have a levelGrid which Chip can move around. Chip will not be able to go off the screen, and Chip's image is correctly set on movement.


Please see my UML diagram for an idea of what is left to do.

# Completed
* Movement of Chip around map
* Loading of basic map
* Simple bounds checking


# In-Progress
* Setting up MVC


Thank you!
Anthony
